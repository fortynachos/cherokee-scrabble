Preface

This dictionary was derived from the raw list of word roots and aﬃxes collected 
by Dr. Duane King in his 1975 University of
Georgia dissertation on the Cherokee language entitled A Grammar and Dictionary 
of the Cherokee Language of the Qualla
Boundary in North Carolina.  The word lists that were included at the end of 
Dr.  King’s dissertation provided word roots
and basic aﬃxes in a printout from his work using IBM computer punch cards that 
he created for a program he described
in his seminal dissertation. This program was devised as a way to generate 
complete verb forms for the major tenses. The
limitations of technology at the time forced Dr.  King to break words down to 
very basic root phonemes and aspect forms
that could ﬁt onto the 88 column punch-card format of the day. Based on these 
entries and the phonetic rules that Dr. King
meticulously derived and documented in his dissertation, in 1975 Bruce Delaney 
generated a punch card program which
sadly no longer appears to exist.  It was able to generate the correct form of 
any verb in the list for any pronominal preﬁx
and tense.

Computer technology has, however, made dramatic advances since 1975.  The major 
hurdle for this work was entering
the data by hand from the barely legible photocopies of the 1975 printout that 
are available today.  The raw data were
painstakingly scrutinized, cross-checked, and manually entered into a database 
created for generating this dictionary which
follows    the format and layout of Dr. Durbin Feeling’s well known work-horse, 
The Cherokee-English Dictionary. This format
was chosen because of the widespread use and familiarity that most students of 
the Cherokee language already have with Dr.
Feeling’s dictionary.  In addition, the very opaque academic phonetics of the 
time have been transcribed to a more readily
accessible and more familiar format based on that of the Cherokee-English 
Dictionary. Syllabary version of the words have
been generated, as well.

Dr. King’s dissertation was a monumental work on the Cherokee language and his 
goal of computerizing the word list was
extremely forward-thinking, ambitious, and praise worthy. Everyone working to 
promote, preserve, or learn the Cherokee
language owes him a huge debt of gratitude for the tremendous amount of work 
and thought he put into his analysis of the
Cherokee language and the word lists that he collected.

The hope that Dr.   King expressed in his dissertation was to “someday 
facilitate the compilation of a nearly complete
Cherokee dictionary.” It is our hope that this dictionary furthers that worthy 
goal. In addition, it is our sincere hope that this
dictionary will become an inspirational resource to help preserve and promote 
the Eastern Cherokee dialect as it is spoken
on      the Qualla Boundary by Dr. King’s informants from Big Cove and their 
descendents. This dictionary is presented in the
spirit of openness, gratitude to the ancestors, gratitude to the people who 
made the original work possible, and especially in
the spirit of ᎦᏚᎩ (community cooperation). It is also our hope that this 
dictionary will not only expand and contribute to the
preservation and growth of the Eastern dialects of the Cherokee language, but 
also be a resource that ﬁlls in gaps in other
resources as it includes many words that are not in the Cherokee-English 
Dictionary or other sources.

Cherokee is grouped into three major dialects:

Elati (ᎡᎳᏘ).  This dialect was historically spoken by inhabitants of the Lower 
Towns in the vicinity of the South Carolina–
Georgia border before the forced removal of 1838 and uses an “r” sound where 
the other two dialects use an “l” sound.
This is also known as “The Lower” dialect. This dialect is believed to have 
become extinct around 1900.

Kituhwa (ᎩᏚᏩ).  Commonly referred to as the “Eastern” dialect, it is spoken by 
the Eastern band on the Qualla Boundary
in North Carolina, and is known as “The Middle” dialect.

Otali (ᎣᏔᎵ).  This dialect is spoken in Oklahoma and by the Snowbird Community 
in North Carolina and is known as the
“Western” or “Overhill” dialect.

The main dictionary is composed of two main parts, a Cherokee to English 
section and an English to Cherokee section. The
Cherokee to English section is what should be used to gain the best 
understanding of each Cherokee word. The English to
Cherokee section’s only purpose is to facilitate lookup of Cherokee entries in 
the Cherokee to English section.  ☞ Always
refer to the Cherokee to English section to ensure correct usage of any word.

In many instances a Cherokee to English entry can have multiple possible 
meanings in English. Such entries are separated
with a semi-colon (;).

Many of the entries contain example sentences. These entries are provided in 
Syllabary and English.
Each Cherokee to English entry can be grouped into one of the following 
categories:

•  Single entries.

•  Dual entries, showing person.

•  Dual entries, showing plurality.

•  Multiple entries, showing person and plurality.

•  Verb entries, showing the third, ﬁrst, and second persons.

•  Verb entries, only showing the third person.

The following provides a brief overview of each entry type.


Single entries.

Many of these entries are single words that are not inﬂected for person or 
quantity.

ᎠᎦᏓ  [ạgada] (pt) “Much.”

ᎠᎦᏳᎳᏗ  [ạgahyụladi] “Net.”

Some of these entries, even though it is not shown, should be inﬂected. 
Familiarity with the language helps with determining
which is which.

Dual entries, showing person.

These entries are identiﬁed by the second entry starting with Ꭶ-, Ꮵ-, ᎠᎩ-, or 
ᎠᏆ-.

Depending on the word, these changes are used to indicate “relationship”, 
“ownership”, “body part”, “worn clothing”, or “to
whom it describes”.

(For most of the following examples assume he could be substituted with she and 
vice-versa.)

Verb entries, showing the third, ﬁrst, and second persons.

Each Cherokee verb has ﬁve core forms or stems that are used to build new 
words. They are listed in the following order:
3rd person present, 1st person present, 3rd person remote past, 3rd person 
habitual, 2nd person immediate, and 3rd person
inﬁnitive.

ᎠᎦᏐᏗᎭ  [agạsoh³dịha] (v) “He is going down hill.”

ᎦᎦᏐᏗᎭ  [gagạsọɂdịha]

ᎤᎦᏐᏔᏅᎢ  [ugạsoh³tạnv²³ɂi]
ᎠᎦᏐᏗᏍᎪᎢ  [agạsoh³dịsgo³ɂi]
ᎭᎦᏐᏓ  [hagạsoh³da]

ᎤᎦᏐᏙᏗ  [ugạsoh³dohdi]

The ﬁrst entries of ᎠᎦᏐᏗᎭ refers directly to the English deﬁnition.  The second 
entry of ᎦᎦᏐᏗᎭ shows the 1st person
inﬂection and in this case means “I am going down hill.”  The ﬁrst form is 
referred to as the P♰♣♱♣♬♲ T♣♬♱♣ stem.  The
second form is the 1st person of the present tense stem.

The next entry of ᎤᎦᏐᏔᏅᎢ is used when talking about what has happened as a 
completed event in the past. This form is
normally used for non-recent events. In this case it means “He went down hill a 
while ago.” This form is referred to as the
R♣♫♭♲♣ P♟♱♲ stem.

The next entry of ᎠᎦᏐᏗᏍᎪᎢ indicates a state of having occurred repeatably in 
the past, with the expectation of the behavior
or action continuing into the future. In this case it means “He often goes down 
hill.” This form is referred to as the H♟♠♧♲♳♟♪
stem.


The next entry of ᎭᎦᏐᏓ indicates that someone is being asked to do something or 
that something recently occurred. Because
it is a form commonly used to ask someone to do something, it is listed in the 
2nd person form. In this particular case, ᎭᎦᏐᏓ
could be translated as either “Let you go down hill” or “You recently went down 
hill” depending on how the ﬁnal syllable is
pronounced on the word. This form is referred to as the I♫♮♣♰♟♲♧♴♣ or I♫♫♣♢♧♟♲♣ 
M♭♢♣ stem.

Finally there is the entry of ᎤᎦᏐᏙᏗ. This form is usually combined with another 
verb.  It is used in a similar manner to
the way “to do …” is used in English or can be used to indicate something 
someone needs to do.  In this case it could be
translated as either “for him to go downhill” or “he needs to go downhill.”  
This form is referred to as the I♬♤♧♬♧♲♧♴♣ or
D♣♴♣♰♠♟♪ stem.

In the following entry there are two 1st person present tense forms and two 3rd 
person immediate mode forms. This reﬂects
a diﬀerence of pronunciation when referring to something animate (ᏥᏯᏎᎯᎭ, ᎯᏯᏎᎧ) 
vs something inanimate (ᎦᏎᎯᎭ, ᎭᏎᎧ)

Some verb entries appear incomplete, such as ᎠᎢ “He is walking”.  Many such 
verbs usually refer to an ongoing state of
being or action, such as walking, and as such only refer to “is doing”, “was 
doing”, or “will be doing”, etc, and do not have
ﬁve stems.

Example Sentences

An example sentence is provided for many of the entries in the Cherokee-English 
section to help further show how the word
is used. These sentences are given in Cherokee with an accompanying English 
translation.

These examples have been taken from works printed in Cherokee, including the 
Bible. Not all words in this edition have an
example but it is our hope to provide example sentences for each entry in a 
following edition.

Vowel Sounds

Cherokee has six main vowels. They are “a”, “e”, “i”, “o”, “u”, and “v”.
They are generally pronounced as follows:

•  a: as a in father, or short as a in rival,

•  e: as a in hate, or short as e in met,

•  i: as i in pique, or short as i in pin,

•  o: as o in note, but approaching to aw, in law,

•  u: as oo in moon, or short as u in pull,

•  v: as u in but, nasalized (sounded through the nose).

Cadence    Each Cherokee vowel is pronounced “long” or “short”. A long vowel is 
a vowel held for a normal length of time.
A short vowel is a vowel spoken for a very brief length of time.  Other than 
for the amount of time a vowel is spoken, the
long and short vowels sound the same. Short vowels will be marked in the 
pronunciation guide with an “underdot”.

☞ Vowels that appear at the end of words in the pronunciation guide are always 
short and will not be displayed with an
underdot. Vowels that are followed by a consonant then a tone mark are also 
always short and will not be displayed with an
underdot.

Examples (the number will be explained shortly):

nịgada         short “i”, long “a”, short “a”

This means “all”.

ạgalị³ha       short “a”, long “a”, short “i”, short “a”

This means “the sun is shining”.

noya            long “o”, short “a”

This means “sand”.

Consonant Sounds

All of the consonants in Cherokee sound the same as their English versions, 
with the following few exceptions:

g: Sounds like either the “g” in “gaﬀ” or the “k” in “kite”. When in doubt, use 
the “g” sound. The pronunciation guide
will be using both the “g” and “k”.

qu: Sounds like the “qu” in “question” or the “gw” in “Gwen”. When in doubt, 
use the “gw” sound. The pronunciation
guide will be using “kw” and “gw”.

•  s: Sounds like the “s” in “sight” for Otali Cherokee or the “sh” in “shell” 
for Kituhwa Cherokee.

tl: This non-English sound is made by combining a “t” or “h” with the “l” sound 
while keeping the tongue’s tip against
the lower front teeth then dropping the tongue straight down. Those new to the 
language will many times think they
are hearing the “cl” sound as found in “clack” or “clock”. With a little 
practice, you will be able to tell the “tl”, “hl”,
and “kl” sounds apart. When in doubt, use the “hl” sound. The pronunciation 
guide will be using “hl” and “tl”.

ts: Sounds like either the “j” in “John”, the “ch” in “chair”, the “ds” in 
“best buds”, or the “tz” in “spritzer”. In Otali
Cherokee the “j” and “ch” soundings are more common. In Kituwah Cherokee, the 
“ds” and “tz” soundings are more
common. The pronunciation guide will be using “ts”.

You will also see trailing and leading “h” sound indicators. These are not 
silent like they are in English, they are always
sounded out.


Pronunciation Guide

Each entry is presented with its Cherokee Syllabary spelling, an English 
pronunciation guide in brackets (“[”, “]”), and an
English deﬁnition.

The following describes the diﬀerent symbols used in the pronunciation guide.

Vowels

a, e, i, o, u, v  - Usually these are long vowels.

☞ Remember that when they are not immediately followed by a tone mark or when 
they appear at the end of a word
they are short vowels.

ạ, ẹ, ị, ọ, ụ, ṿ  - These are always short vowels.

Pausing

ɂ  - A dotless question mark indicates a brief pause in speaking. This is 
called a glottal stop.

Examples of this brief pause can be found in the middle of the English words: 
“uh-oh”, “stoplight”, and “workload”.

Miscellaneous

,  - This will be used to indicate pronunciation and spelling variations. 
Example:

ᎦᎱᏍᏗ, ᎪᎱᏍᏗ  [gạhụsdi, gọhụsdi] (pt) “Something.; Anything.”

Tone    What is pitch or tone? Pitch or tone, when dealing with languages, 
refers to shifting the tone of the voice up or down.
An example of this in English is the shifting of the tone upwards towards the 
end of a sentence when asking a question. In
Cherokee shifts in tone are actually considered parts of words and can also be 
used to indicate things like “happened in the
past” or “let it happen in the future”. ☞ The tones used in words or phrases 
can change their meaning, sometimes dramatically.

In this material, the CED numbering system is being used, where:

A “²” indicates a tone with a normal pitch.  ☞ This tone is commonly referred 
to as the “normal”, “low”, or “neutral”
tone.

•  A “³” indicates a tone with a higher pitch. ☞ This tone is commonly referred 
to as the “high” tone.

Many words have parts with “contour” or “gliding” tones.  These will be 
indicated by combining together the starting and
ending pitches:

A “²³” indicates a tone that starts out at a normal pitch and then is glided 
higher in pitch.  ☞ This tone is commonly
referred to as the “rising” tone.

A “³²” indicates a tone that starts out at a higher pitch and then is glided 
down to a normal pitch.  ☞ This tone is
commonly referred to as the “falling” tone.

There are two more tones which will be only marked with single numbers and one 
special gliding tone that has no marking
at all:

A “¹” indicates a tone that starts with a normal pitch and then is glided 
downwards. ☞ This tone is commonly referred
to as the “extra low fall” or “low fall” tone.

A “⁴” indicates a tone that starts out usually at either “normal” or “high”, 
the closest matching the preceding syllable,
and then is glided upwards in pitch to end higher than the “high” tone.  ☞ This 
tone is commonly referred to as the
“extra high rise” or “high rise” tone.

At the end of every word, unless otherwise indicated, there is always a “⁴³” 
gliding tone which starts out with an very
high pitch and then is glided down very far. Because this is at the end of 
every word, it is not marked. ☞ This tone is
commonly referred to as the “extra high fall” or “high fall” tone.

Only the most critical tones, as recorded by Dr. King, have been marked in the 
pronunciation entries.


Things of note

Stress    Unlike English, where you stress diﬀerent syllables in words with 
loudness you should try and keep all the syllables
in your Cherokee words held at an equal volume. As a general rule, one should 
only stress an ending vowel that has the high
fall tone when speaking Cherokee. ☞ Speaking with this diﬀerent way of using 
stress takes a bit of practice. It is second nature
for English speakers to stress certain parts of words without realizing they 
are doing so.

Nasalization    When speaking Cherokee, the “v” and “ṿ” vowels are always 
nasalized.  (Sending the sound through the
nose).  Additionally, the ending sound on each word is also nasalized.  The 
English word “huh”, contains an example of a
nasalized “v”.

Tongue Placement    Cherokee is spoken with the tip of the tongue against the 
lower front teeth most of the time.  You
should be using the middle of your tongue to make the “s”, “d”, and “t” sounds, 
not the tongue’s tip. Keeping your tongue
properly placed takes practice, but is critical for properly emulating native 
pronunciation. Do not give up.

The Intrusive “H”    Because of the way Cherokee is spoken, you will sometimes 
see an extra “h” added to the beginning
of a syllable in the pronunciation guide, even though the matching syllabary 
character does not indicate any “h” sounds. This
extra sound is called The Intrusive “H”. Except for the special Cherokee 
letters Ꮏ, “hna”, and Ꮐ, “nah”, this sound is not
written. The amount of Intrusive “H” will vary from speaker to speaker, so you 
will hear the same words spoken with and
without it to varying degrees.

All entries in the Cherokee-English section of this dictionary are labeled with 
a traditional part of speech marker. We have
taken the liberty to alter some of King’s original word list parts of speech 
notations in this current edition for clarity and
familiarity. King originally did not diﬀerentiate between transitive and 
intransitive verbs in his word lists and showed only
VBST for all verbs . Since these parts of speech are familiar to students of 
language, we have opted to follow the example
of the Feeling/Pulte Cherokee-English Dictionary, Montgomery-Anderson’s A 
Reference Grammar of Oklahoma Cherokee
and other works on the Cherokee language and added the distinction between the 
two verb types to this work. However, we
have opted to simplify King’s varying noun categories down to just one because 
they are less familiar to language learners.

The parts of speech noted in this work are:

(vi)             – Intransitive Verb.  These are verbs that do not take a 
direct object.  Verbs of motion and stative verbs are
intransitive.

(vt)             – Transitive Verb. These are verbs that allow one or more 
direct objects.

(n)              – Noun.

(adj)           – Adjective.

(pt)             – Particle.  Particles are words that do not change or do not 
easily ﬁt into grammatical categories and include
words that indicate passage of time, i.e.  while, in a while, later.  Note:  
King originally also included adverbs
and adjectives as particles because the distinction between the two in Cherokee 
is often ﬂuid.

࿮࿿ဆ C࿵࿲࿿࿼࿸࿲࿲

One of the ﬁrst noticeable diﬀerences between the two major dialects of 
Cherokee (West vs East or Oklahoma vs Qualla)
is the pronunciation of /s/.  In the west, this is generally pronounced like an 
English ”s” sound.  On the Qualla Boundary,
however, before vowels it generally sounds like ”sh” so we get forms that sound 
like “oshiyo”, “shogwili”, “shikwa”. It is also
generally pronounced as English “sh” in front of “g” or “k” so we get words 
that sound like “shgi” and “nashgi” or “hishgi”
and “shgohi”. However, before “d” and “t” it tends to remain as “s” so we hear 
“osda”, “usdi”, etc. in both dialects.

Another diﬀerence in pronunciation that has been documented is that often (not 
always) “tl” and “dl” in the West are “ts” in
Qualla pronunciations. A few examples are:


West             East             English

tlesdi            tsesdi           don’t!

didla             iditsa, itsa     towards

tla                tsa               no, not
galvladidla    galvladitsv    upwards
uyvdla          uyvts            cold
tlameha        tsamaha        bat

Sometimes the diﬀerence between Oklahoma Cherokee and Qualla Boundary Cherokee 
is that the /tl/ in the West is pro-
nounced as an aspirated /hl/ on the Qualla Boundary. For example:

West                   East                      English

gitli                    gihli                     dog
adetlogwa’a         adehlogwa’a          he is learning
jundetlogwasdi    tsundehlogwasdi    school
uditlega               udihlegi                hot

odla                    ohla                      soap

Another diﬀerence often encountered between West and East is long /a/ (West) 
versus /o/ (East):

West      East         English

kawi       kowi        coﬀee

hawa      howa        Well!, Okay!
nagwu    nogwo      now

sagwu     shogwo    one
sadu       sho’adu    eleven

The /ts-/ syllables are represented and pronounced diﬀerently between the two, 
also. In Western pronunciation these syllables
are usually pronounced /ch-/ or /j-/. On the Qualla Boundary, they tend to be 
pronounced /ts-/ or /dz-/. Examples:

West        East        English
jisdu        tsisdu      rabbit
jalagi       tsalagi     Cherokee

jisdvna    tsisvna    crayﬁsh, crawdad

There are some speciﬁc words and usages also that are diﬀerent. The following 
list by no means is exhaustive but these are
some of the most used ones:

West                  East                                English

ale                     nole                                and

hatlv                   gatsv (tl/ts!)                     where?

hila                    hvga                               how?

hila iga               hvga iga                          how many? (inanimate)

hila iyani            hvga iyani                        how many? (animate)

hilayv                 hvga iyv                          when?

tla yi-                 gesdi yi-                          not (negating a 
sentence)

tla …. yigi          gesdi …. yigi                   not (negating an adjective 
or noun)
tla yagwahnta      gesdi yitsigata                  I don’t know.

tlesdi                  tsesdi or hesdi                  Don’t!

tla, vtla               hadi                                No.
agilvgwodi(ha)    osd agiyeli, tsalvgwdiha    he likes it
tla gohusdi          (ges)di gohusdi                nothing

tamatli                uneguhisdi                      tomato

☞ Tsalvgwdiha in NC (note the Type A preﬁx!) is more emphatic & means “I really 
like it” or “I love it!”)

☞ Tamatli is a borrowing from Nahuatl.

Sometimes the diﬀerences are a little more subtle:


West               East                          English
gado usdi         gado iyusdi, doyust    what?

dodagohvi        dedagohvyu               See you later!
donadagohvi    dendagohvyu             See you all later!

Plural nouns - In several cases, there is a diﬀerence between how plural nouns 
are treated between East and West, with
Western dialect adding a plural marker preﬁx (di- or de-) whereas the Eastern 
dialect does not. Examples:

West                        East

Singular    Plural       Singular    Plural    English
yvgi          diyvgi      yvgi          yvgi       forks
telido        ditelido    telido        telido     plates

There are many more examples of diﬀerences but none of these are major enough 
to prevent communication between Eastern
and Western ﬂuent Cherokee speakers any more than the diﬀerences between an 
American and a British speaker, or for that
matter, between Americans from diﬀerent regions of the United States.  For 
example, a “pan” in some parts of the United
States means speciﬁcally a “frying pan” while in other places it refers to a 
“sauce pan” – which many speakers call a “pot”.
Folks in the Appalachian Mountains say “thar” and “whar” instead of “there” and 
“where” but communication still happens
and it’s still English.  And, of course, there are many regional words in 
America that are well known.  For instance, youse
guys, you people, y’all, and – in Western NC – You’uns (which is “Youns” near 
Pittsburg)!

So don’t get stuck over the diﬀerences in the Cherokee dialects. Just be aware 
of them and then relax and learn to appreciate
and enjoy them!

Grammar

Please take note:

The following is from the ”Brief Specimens of Cherokee Grammatical Forms” as 
printed in the ”The Cherokee Messenger
(ᏣᎳᎩ ᎠᏥᏅᏏᏛ)” in the years 1844 to 1846.

The original text used ’ds’ for the soft ’ts’ sound. These have been replaced 
with ’ts’ to be consistent with the entirety
of the dictionary. Additionally “qu” has been replaced with “kw” to be 
consistent with the usage of “gw” in the rest
of the text.

The following description of Cherokee grammar is for 1840’s Cherokee and not 
today’s Cherokee.   While most
diﬀerences between the two are minor, there are diﬀerences.  The material is 
very useful when working with the
Cherokee New Testament, the Cherokee translation of Genesis, the Cherokee 
translation of Pilgrim’s Progress, and
so forth.

The English text is also from the 1840’s and has not been “modernized”. It is 
important to understand that “thee” and
“thou” are used to indicate “you one” and that “ye” and “you” are used to 
indicate “you two or more”.

•  Some re-arrangment of text, tables, and minor changes of wording have 
happened to facilitate e-book creation.

P࿿࿼࿻࿼ဂ࿻က

The Cherokee language has but two separable personal pronouns, viz.: First 
person singular and plural, A-yv (ᎠᏴ), “I and
we.” Second person singular and plural, ni-hi (ᏂᎯ), “thou and you.” The third 
person is indicated by na (Ꮎ) or na-ski (ᎾᏍᎩ),
“that,” or hi-ya (ᎯᏯ) or hi-a (ᎯᎠ) “this,” or by a verb expressing some 
attribute or condition of the person spoken of, as:—

ᏥᎦᏙᎦ,     tsi-ga-do-ga,    the one who is standing,
ᏤᏙᎠ,      tse-do-a,          the one who is moving about,
ᏧᏬᎳ,      tsu-wo-hla,      the one who is sitting down,
ᏥᎦᏅᎦ,    tsi-ga-nv-ga,     the one who is lying down,
ᏨᏓᏯᎢ,     tsv-da-ya-i,      the one who is coming,
ᏥᏩᎢ,      tsi-wa-i,           the one who is going,
ᏥᏲᎱᏒ,     tsi-yo-hu-sv,    the one who is dead,

ᏤᎭ,         tse-ha,             the one who is living,
ᏧᏢᎦ,         tsu-tlv-ga,        the one who is sick,

The Cherokee language has a form of personal pronouns, which may be termed 
reﬂexive; in which all the distinctions of
person are indicated. This form has the sense of myself, thyself, &c., as the 
following will exhibit.

Singular.

1st person      ᎠᎬᏒ     a-gwv-sv    myself,
2nd person    ᏨᏒ       tsv-sv         thyself,
3rd person     ᎤᏩᏒ    u-wa-sv      himself,

Dual.

1st and 2nd person    ᎩᏅᏒ       gi-nv-sv       ourselves, (thyself and myself)
1st and 3rd person     ᎣᎩᏅᏒ    o-gi-nv-sv    ourselves, (himself and myself)
2nd person               ᏍᏛᏒ       sdv-sv          yourselves, (two)

Plural.

1st and 2nd person    ᎢᎬᏒ      i-gv-sv     ourselves, (yourselves and myself)
1st and 3rd person     ᎣᎬᏒ      o-gv-sv    ourselves, (themselves and myself)
2nd person               ᎢᏨᏒ     i-tsv-sv     yourselves, (three or more)

3rd person                ᎤᏅᏒ    u-nv-sv    themselves

The following table exhibits the possessive pronouns; the object possessed 
being singular.

Singular.

1st person      ᎠᏆᏤᎵ    a-kwa-tse-li    mine,
2nd person    ᏣᏤᎵ       tsa-tse-li         thine,
3rd person     ᎤᏤᎵ      u-tse-li           his,

Dual.

1st and 2nd person    ᎩᎾᏤᎵ       gi-na-tse-li       ours, (mine and thine)
1st and 3rd person     ᎣᎩᎾᏤᎵ    o-gi-na-tse-li    ours, (his and mine)
2nd person               ᏍᏓᏤᎵ       sda-tse-li          yours, (two)

Plural.

1st and 2nd person    ᎢᎦᏤᎵ      i-ga-tse-li     ours, (yours and mine)
1st and 3rd person     ᎣᎦᏤᎵ     o-ga-tse-li    ours, (theirs and mine)
2nd person               ᎢᏣᏤᎵ     i-tsa-tse-li     yours, (three or more)
3rd person                ᎤᎾᏤᎵ    u-na-tse-li    theirs.

Oဃ࿲࿿ဃ࿶࿲င ࿼࿳ V࿲࿿࿯က

The simplest form in which we ﬁnd being and tense, indicated in Cherokee, is in 
the Impersonal Substantive Verb ge-sv-i

(ᎨᏒᎢ), “being,” and i-gi (ᎢᎩ), “is.”

I࿻࿱࿶࿰࿮ခ࿶ဃ࿲ M࿼࿼࿱

Verbal noun,                     ᎨᏒᎢ       ge-sv-i       being

Conditional or habitual,      ᎨᏐᎢ       ge-so-i       is, (usually, habitually, 
or on certain occasions,)
Imperfect - conscious,        ᎨᏒᎩ      ge-sv-gi      was, (with personal 
knowlege, or consciousness,)
Imperfect  - unconscious,    ᎨᏎᎢ       ge-se-i        was, (without personal 
knowlege, or consciousness,)
Future tense,                     ᎨᏎᏍᏗ    ge-se-sdi    will be.

The distinctions indicated by the inﬂections of this verb, are combined with 
several of the simple tenses of regular verbs,
forming compounds by which many very minute divisions of time, are marked with 
great precision.

The ge-so-i (ᎨᏐᎢ) inﬂection modiﬁes the principal tense, so, as to indicate the 
usual, customary or habitual prevalence of
what is aﬃrmed, in quantity, quality or frequency: or under certain 
circumstances or conditions.

N♭♲♣: The terms which, in this material, are given to the conjugations, moods, 
tenses, and other distinctions,
indicated by the inﬂections of the Cherokee verb, are only used provisionally; 
such terms vary widely in other
materials.

C࿼࿻࿷ဂ࿴࿮ခ࿶࿼࿻က

The regular Cherokee verb has nine conjugations, viz:

Present Tense and its Modiﬁcations.

ᎧᏁᎦ         ka-ne-ga          he is speaking,

ᎧᏁᎪᎢ      ka-ne-go-i       he is peaking habitually, or on certain occasions,

ᎧᏁᎨᏍᏗ    ka-ne-ge-sdi    he will be speaking,

ᎧᏁᎬᎢ       ka-ne-gv-i       his speaking, or his word.


Of these forms, ka-ne-gv-gi (ᎧᏁᎬᎩ), indicates the presence or personal 
knowledge of the person who relates the fact: ka-
ne-ge-i (ᎧᏁᎨᎢ), the absence of personal knowledge.

The Present Tense, showing the distinctions of person, and the modiﬁcations of

-ᎨᏍᏗ    -ge-sdi    I &c. will be speaking.

-ᎬᎢ       -gv-i       My, thy, his, &c. speaking, or word.

By connecting each of these terminations with each of the persons of the verb, 
all the modications of this tense will be
expressed in each person, thus, tsi-ne-ga (ᏥᏁᎦ), “I am speaking,” hi-ne-ga 
(ᎯᏁᎦ), “thou art speaking,” &c.

If the English aﬃxed to each modiﬁcation of this tense, varied to suit the 
person, be aﬃxed to the verb, with the corresponding
termination as in the tables, all the variations of person and tense will be 
expressed. This remark is applicable to the other
tenses which admit of similar variations.
